# Game Networking - Spring 2021

This repository was used by Scott Dagen and Ben Cooper to create a networked cooperative game in Unity.

To run the game, download Unity Hub version 2020.3.0f1 and open the project. Building the server requires only the 
server scene, while the client requires both the Client and ClientMenu scenes.
